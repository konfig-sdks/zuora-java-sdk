|**cardHolderInfo** | [**CreatePaymentMethodCardholderInfo**](CreatePaymentMethodCardholderInfo.md) |  |  |
|**cardNumber** | **String** | Credit card number.  |  |
|**cardType** | **String** | The type of the credit card. Possible values include &#x60;Visa&#x60;, &#x60;MasterCard&#x60;, &#x60;AmericanExpress&#x60;, &#x60;Discover&#x60;, &#x60;JCB&#x60;, and &#x60;Diners&#x60;. For more information about credit card types supported by different payment gateways, see [Supported Payment Gateways](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/Supported_Payment_Gateways).  |  |
|**checkDuplicated** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the duplication check is performed when you create a new credit card payment method. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;.  With this field set to &#x60;true&#x60;, Zuora will check all active payment methods associated with the same billing account to ensure that no duplicate credit card payment methods are created. An error is returned if a duplicate payment method is found.          The following fields are used for the duplication check:   - &#x60;cardHolderName&#x60;   - &#x60;expirationMonth&#x60;   - &#x60;expirationYear&#x60;   - &#x60;creditCardMaskNumber&#x60;. It is the masked credit card number generated by Zuora. For example, &#x60;************1234&#x60;.  **This field is being deprecated.**  To achieve the same purpose, use the &#x60;processingOptions&#x60; &gt; &#x60;checkDuplicated&#x60; field of the payment method object.  |  [optional] |
|**expirationMonth** | **Integer** | One or two digit expiration month (1-12) of the credit card.  |  |
|**expirationYear** | **Integer** | Four-digit expiration year of the credit card.  |  |
|**identityNumber** | **String** | The identity number of the cardholder. This field is required for Credit Card payment methods in certain countries such as Brazil.  |  [optional] |
|**mitConsentAgreementRef** | **String** | Specifies your reference for the stored credential consent agreement that you have established with the customer. Only applicable if you set the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field.  |  [optional] |
|**mitConsentAgreementSrc** | [**MitConsentAgreementSrcEnum**](#MitConsentAgreementSrcEnum) | Required if you set the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field. Specifies how the consent agreement has been established with the customer. The allowed value is &#x60;External&#x60;. If you do not specify the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value &#x60;External&#x60; set to this field.  |  [optional] |
|**mitNetworkTransactionId** | **String** | Specifies the ID of a network transaction. Only applicable if you set the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field to &#x60;Persist&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**mitProfileAction** | [**MitProfileActionEnum**](#MitProfileActionEnum) | Specifies how Zuora creates and activates the stored credential profile.  - &#x60;Activate&#x60; - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential profile after receiving the customer&#39;s consent.    Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be &#x60;Active&#x60;. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.      If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be &#x60;Agreed&#x60;.   - &#x60;Persist&#x60; - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment method&#39;s stored credential profile will be &#x60;Active&#x60;.  If you do not specify this field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value &#x60;Activate&#x60; set to this field.  |  [optional] |
|**mitProfileAgreedOn** | **LocalDate** | The date on which the profile is agreed. The date format is &#x60;yyyy-mm-dd&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**mitProfileType** | [**MitProfileTypeEnum**](#MitProfileTypeEnum) | Required if you set the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field. Indicates the type of the stored credential profile to process recurring or unsecheduled transactions. If you do not specify the &#x60;mitProfileAction&#x60; field, Zuora will automatically create a stored credential profile for the payment method, with the default value &#x60;Recurring&#x60; set to this field.  |  [optional] |
|**screeningAmount** | **Double** | For &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Payments/Payment_gateway_integrations/Supported_payment_gateways/Chase_Orbital_Payment_Gateway\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway&lt;/a&gt; integrations, if the Safetech Fraud service is enabled, use this field to pass in the amount used for fraud screening for Credit Card validation transactions.

|**processingOptions** | [**CreatePaymentMethodCreditCardAllOfProcessingOptions**](CreatePaymentMethodCreditCardAllOfProcessingOptions.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**accountKey** | **String** | Internal ID of the customer account that will own the payment method.   To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any customer account, you do not need to specify this field during creation. However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a customer account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method will be deleted.  |  [optional] |
|**authGateway** | **String** | Internal ID of the payment gateway that Zuora will use to authorize the payments that are made with the payment method.  If you do not set this field, Zuora will use one of the following payment gateways instead:  * The default payment gateway of the customer account that owns the payment method, if the &#x60;accountKey&#x60; field is set. * The default payment gateway of your Zuora tenant, if the &#x60;accountKey&#x60; field is not set.  |  [optional] |
|**currencyCode** | **String** | The currency used for payment method authorization.  |  [optional] |
|**gatewayOptions** | [**PaymentMethodCommonFieldsGatewayOptions**](PaymentMethodCommonFieldsGatewayOptions.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**ipAddress** | **String** | The IPv4 or IPv6 information of the user when the payment method is created or updated. Some gateways use this field for fraud prevention. If this field is passed to Zuora, Zuora directly passes it to gateways.   If the IP address length is beyond 45 characters, a validation error occurs.  For validating SEPA payment methods on Stripe v2, this field is required.  |  [optional] |
|**makeDefault** | **Boolean** | Specifies whether the payment method will be the default payment method of the customer account that owns the payment method. Only applicable if the &#x60;accountKey&#x60; field is set.  When you set this field to &#x60;true&#x60;, make sure the payment method is supported by the default payment gateway.  |  [optional] |
|**skipValidation** | **Boolean** | Specify whether to skip the validation of the information through the payment gateway. For example, when migrating your payment methods, you can set this field to &#x60;true&#x60; to skip the validation.   |  [optional] |
