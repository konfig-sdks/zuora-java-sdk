# ProcessingOptionsOrdersWithDelayedCapturePayment

The container for billing processing options and payment processing options.  **Note:** - This field is not supported in draft orders. - When you use the \"Create an order\" operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. In this case, neither the invoice will be generated, nor the subscription nor the account will be created. - When you use the \"Create an order\" operation to cancel a subscription with `refund` and `writeOff`, if the `refund` or `writeOff` fails, `cancelSubscription`, `runBilling`, and `collectPayment` still can succeed. - When you use the \"Create an order\" operation, the `collectPayment` and `refund` fields cannot be set to `true` simultaneously.  Otherwise, the order will not be proceeded. 

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**applicationOrder** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | The priority order to apply credit memos and/or unapplied payments to an invoice. Possible item values are: &#x60;CreditMemo&#x60;, &#x60;UnappliedPayment&#x60;.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the &#x60;applyCredit&#x60; field is set to &#x60;true&#x60;.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\&quot;CreditMemo\&quot;, \&quot;UnappliedPayment\&quot;], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is &#x60;[\&quot;CreditMemo\&quot;]&#x60;, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices.  |  [optional] |
|**applyCredit** | **Boolean** | Whether to automatically apply credit memos or unapplied payments, or both to an invoice.  If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.             **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

The value must be an existing payment refund reason code listed in **Payments Settings** &gt; **Configure Reason Codes**.
