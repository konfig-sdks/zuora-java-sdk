Cancel a subscription

This REST API reference describes how to cancel an active subscription.  **Note**: If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

    Zuora client = new Zuora(configuration);
    String cancellationPolicy = "cancellationPolicy_example"; // Cancellation method. Possible values are: `EndOfCurrentTerm`, `EndOfLastInvoicePeriod`, `SpecificDate`. If using `SpecificDate`, the `cancellationEffectiveDate` field is required. 
    String subscriptionKey = "subscriptionKey_example"; // Subscription number or ID. Subscription status must be `Active`.
    List<String> applicationOrder = Arrays.asList(); // The priority order to apply credit memos and/or unapplied payments to an invoice. Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\\\"CreditMemo\\\", \\\"UnappliedPayment\\\"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `[\\\"CreditMemo\\\"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices. 
    Boolean applyCredit = true; // If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.  **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 
    Boolean applyCreditBalance = true; // Whether to automatically apply a credit balance to an invoice.  If the value is `true`, the credit balance is applied to the invoice. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.   To view the credit balance adjustment, retrieve the details of the invoice using the Get Invoices method.  Prerequisite: `invoice` must be `true`.   **Note:**    - If you are using the field `invoiceCollect` rather than the field `invoice`, the `invoiceCollect` value must be `true`.   - This field is deprecated if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled. 
    LocalDate bookingDate = LocalDate.now(); // The booking date that you want to set for the amendment contract when you cancel the subscription. The default value is the current date when you make the API call. 
    LocalDate cancellationEffectiveDate = LocalDate.now(); // Date the cancellation takes effect, in the format yyyy-mm-dd.  Use only if `cancellationPolicy` is `SpecificDate`. Should not be earlier than the subscription contract-effective date, later than the subscription term-end date, or within a period for which the customer has been invoiced. 
    Boolean collect = false; // Collects an automatic payment for a subscription. The collection generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.  If the value is `true`, the automatic payment is collected. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.  Prerequisite: The `invoice` or `runBilling` field must be `true`.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `196.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). 
    LocalDate contractEffectiveDate = LocalDate.now(); // The date when the customer notifies you that they want to cancel their subscription. 
    String creditMemoReasonCode = "creditMemoReasonCode_example"; // A code identifying the reason for the credit memo transaction that is generated by the request. The value must be an existing reason code. If you do not pass the field or pass the field with empty value, Zuora uses the default reason code.
    LocalDate documentDate = LocalDate.now(); // The date of the billing document, in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. It represents the invoice date for invoices, credit memo date for credit memos, and debit memo date for debit memos.  - If this field is specified, the specified date is used as the billing document date.  - If this field is not specified, the date specified in the `targetDate` is used as the billing document date. 
    Boolean invoice = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `runBilling` field. The `invoice` field is only available for backward compatibility.   Creates an invoice for a subscription. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   If the value is `true`, an invoice is created. If the value is `false`, no action is taken. The default value is `false`.    This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `196.0` and `207.0`. To use this field in the method, you must set the zuora-version parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    Boolean invoiceCollect = false; // This field has been replaced by the `invoice` field and the `collect` field. `invoiceCollect` is available only for backward compatibility.  If this field is set to `true`, an invoice is generated and payment automatically collected.  **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `186.0`, `187.0`, `188.0`, or `189.0`. 
    LocalDate invoiceTargetDate = LocalDate.now(); // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `targetDate` field. The `invoiceTargetDate` field is only available for backward compatibility.   Date through which to calculate charges if an invoice is generated, as yyyy-mm-dd. Default is current date.   This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `207.0` and earlier [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). 
    LocalDate orderDate = LocalDate.now(); // The date when the order is signed. If no additinal contractEffectiveDate is provided, this order will use this order date as the contract effective date. This field must be in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format. This field is required for Orders customers only, not applicable to Orders Harmonization customers.  
    Boolean runBilling = true; // Creates an invoice for a subscription. If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, a credit memo might also be created based on the [invoice and credit memo generation rule](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/Credit_and_Debit_Memos/Rules_for_Generating_Invoices_and_Credit_Memos).     The billing documents generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   Possible values:  - `true`: An invoice is created. If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, a credit memo might also be created.   - `false`: No invoice is created.   **Note:** This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `211.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). To use this field in the method, you must set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    LocalDate targetDate = LocalDate.now(); // Date through which to calculate charges if an invoice or a credit memo is generated, as yyyy-mm-dd. Default is current date.   **Note:** The credit memo is only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.   This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `211.0` and later. To use this field in the method, you must set the  `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    String acceptEncoding = "acceptEncoding_example"; // Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
    String contentEncoding = "contentEncoding_example"; // Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
    String authorization = "authorization_example"; // The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
    String zuoraTrackId = "zuoraTrackId_example"; // A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
    String zuoraEntityIds = "zuoraEntityIds_example"; // An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
    String zuoraOrgIds = "zuoraOrgIds_example"; // Comma separated IDs. If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **subscriptionKey** | **String**| Subscription number | |
| **acceptEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] |
| **contentEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] |
| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |

Preview a subscription

The REST API reference describes how to create a new subscription in preview mode. This call does not require a valid customer account. It can be used to show potential new customers a preview of a subscription with complete details and charges before creating an account, or to let existing customers preview a subscription with all charges before committing.  ### Notes - The response of the Preview Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers.   - If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, we recommend that you set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;207.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error is returned.   - Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows.  |        | serviceActivationDate (SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default | | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

Renew a subscription

Renews a termed subscription using existing renewal terms.  When you renew a subscription, the current subscription term is extended by creating a new term.   If any charge in your subscription has the billing period set as &#x60;SubscriptionTerm&#x60;， a new charge segment is generated for the new term.   **Note**: If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\\\"CreditMemo\\\", \\\"UnappliedPayment\\\"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `[\\\"CreditMemo\\\"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices. 
    Boolean applyCredit = true; // If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.  **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

If the value is `false`, no action is taken.   To view the credit balance adjustment, retrieve the details of the invoice using the Get Invoices method.  Prerequisite: `invoice` must be `true`.   **Note:**    - If you are using the field `invoiceCollect` rather than the field `invoice`, the `invoiceCollect` value must be `true`.   - This field is deprecated if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.

To use this field in the method, you must set the zuora-version parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    Boolean invoiceCollect = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `invoice` field and the `collect` field. `invoiceCollect` is available only for backward compatibility.   If this field is set to `true`, an invoice is generated and payment collected automatically during the subscription process. If `false`, no invoicing or payment takes place. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `186.0`, `187.0`, `188.0`, or `189.0`.

The billing documents generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   Possible values:  - `true`: An invoice is created. If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, a credit memo might also be created.   - `false`: No invoice is created.   **Note:** This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `211.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version).

| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraVersion** | **String**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You only need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * invoice * collect * runBilling * targetDate   | [optional] |

Resume a subscription

This REST API reference describes how to resume a suspended subscription.    **Note**: If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

Values:  * `Today`: The subscription resumption takes effect on today's date.  * `FixedPeriodsFromSuspendDate`: The subscription resumption takes effect after a specified period based on the suspend date. You must specify the `resumePeriods` and `resumePeriodsType` fields to define the period.  * `SpecificDate`: The subscription resumption takes effect on a specific date. You must define the specific date in the `resumeSpecificDate` field.  * `FixedPeriodsFromToday`: The subscription resumption takes effect after a specified period based on the today's date. You must specify the `resumePeriods` and `resumePeriodsType` fields to define the period. * `suspendDate`: The subscription resumption takes effect on the date of suspension of the subscription.

Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\\\"CreditMemo\\\", \\\"UnappliedPayment\\\"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `[\\\"CreditMemo\\\"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices. 
    Boolean applyCredit = true; // If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.  **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information.

If the value is `false`, no action is taken.   To view the credit balance adjustment, retrieve the details of the invoice using the Get Invoices method.  Prerequisite: `invoice` must be `true`.   **Note:**    - If you are using the field `invoiceCollect` rather than the field `invoice`, the `invoiceCollect` value must be `true`.   - This field is deprecated if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled. 
    LocalDate bookingDate = LocalDate.now(); // The booking date that you want to set for the amendment contract when you resume the subscription. If `extendsTerm` is `true`, which means you also extend the term, then this field is also the booking date for the Terms and Conditions amendment contract.

It represents the invoice date for invoices, credit memo date for credit memos, and debit memo date for debit memos.  - If this field is specified, the specified date is used as the billing document date.  - If this field is not specified, the date specified in the `targetDate` is used as the billing document date. 
    Boolean extendsTerm = true; // Whether to extend the subscription term by the length of time the suspension is in effect.  Values: `true`, `false`. 
    Boolean invoice = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `runBilling` field. The `invoice` field is only available for backward compatibility.   Creates an invoice for a subscription. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   If the value is `true`, an invoice is created. If the value is `false`, no action is taken. The default value is `false`.   This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `196.0` and `207.0`. To use this field in the method, you must set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    Boolean invoiceCollect = false; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `invoice` field and the `collect` field. `invoiceCollect` is available only for backward compatibility.   If `true`, an invoice is generated and payment collected automatically during the subscription process. If `false`, no invoicing or payment takes place.  The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `186.0`, `187.0`, `188.0`, or `189.0`.

This REST API reference describes how to create a new subscription for an existing customer account.  ### Notes  If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.  If &#x60;invoiceCollect&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, the call will not return &#x60;success&#x60; &#x3D; &#x60;true&#x60; unless the subscription, invoice, and payment are all successful.  Default values for **customerAcceptanceDate** and **serviceActivationDate** are set as follows. This API operation does not support creating a pending subscription.  |        | serviceActivationDate(SA) specified          | serviceActivationDate (SA) NOT specified  | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) specified| SA uses value in the request call; CA uses value in the request call| CA uses value in the request call;SA uses CE as default | | customerAcceptanceDate (CA) NOT specified      | SA uses value in the request call; CA uses SA as default |   SA and CA use CE as default |

Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\\\"CreditMemo\\\", \\\"UnappliedPayment\\\"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `[\\\"CreditMemo\\\"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices. 
    Boolean applyCredit = true; // If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.   **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 
    Boolean applyCreditBalance = true; // Whether to automatically apply a credit balance to an invoice.  If the value is `true`, the credit balance is applied to the invoice. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.   To view the credit balance adjustment, retrieve the details of the invoice using the Get Invoices method.  Prerequisite: `invoice` must be `true`.   **Note:**    - If you are using the field `invoiceCollect` rather than the field `invoice`, the `invoiceCollect` value must be `true`.   - This field is deprecated if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.

If the value is `true`, the automatic payment is collected. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.  Prerequisite: The `invoice` or `runBilling` field must be `true`.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `196.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version).

If Payment Gateway Routing is disabled:   - If this field is not specified, the default payment gateway will be used to process the payment. The default gateway of the customer account takes precedence over the default gateway of the tenant.    - If this field is specified, the specified gateway will be used to process the payment. 
    Long initialTerm = 56L; // The length of the period for the first subscription term. If `termType` is `TERMED`, then this field is required, and the value must be greater than `0`. If `termType` is `EVERGREEN`, this field is ignored.

Creates an invoice for a subscription. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   If the value is `true`, an invoice is created. If the value is `false`, no action is taken. The default value is `true`.    This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `196.0` and `207.0`. To use this field in the method, you must set the zuora-version parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    Boolean invoiceCollect = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `invoice` field and the `collect` field. `invoiceCollect` is available only for backward compatibility.   If this field is set to `true`, an invoice is generated and payment collected automatically during the subscription process. If `false`, no invoicing or payment takes place. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `186.0`, `187.0`, `188.0`, or `189.0`.

This field is writable only when the subscription is newly created as a first version subscription. You can override the date value when creating a subscription through the Subscribe and Amend API or the subscription creation UI (non-Orders). Otherwise, the default value `today` is set per the user's timezone. The value of this field is as follows: * For a new subscription created by the [Subscribe and Amend APIs](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Migration_Guidance#Subscribe_and_Amend_APIs_to_Migrate), this field has the value of the subscription creation date. * For a subscription changed by an amendment, this field has the value of the amendment booking date. * For a subscription created or changed by an order, this field has the value of the order date.

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **poSTSubscriptionType** | [**POSTSubscriptionType**](POSTSubscriptionType.md)|  | |
| **idempotencyKey** | **String**| Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.   With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident.   | [optional] |
| **acceptEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] |
| **contentEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] |
| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraVersion** | **String**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You only need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * invoice * collect * runBilling * targetDate  | [optional] |

### Return type

[**POSTSubscriptionResponseType**](POSTSubscriptionResponseType.md)

### Authorization

 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** |  |  * Content-Encoding - This header is returned if you specify the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; request header and the response contains over 1000 bytes of data. Note that only the following MIME types support gzipped responses:   - &#x60;application/json&#x60;   - &#x60;application/xml&#x60;   - &#x60;text/html&#x60;   - &#x60;text/csv&#x60;   - &#x60;text/plain&#x60;  <br>  * RateLimit-Limit - The request limit quota for the time window closest to exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * RateLimit-Remaining - The number of requests remaining in the time window closest to quota exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * RateLimit-Reset - The number of seconds until the quota resets for the time window closest to quota exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * Zuora-Request-Id - The Zuora internal identifier of the API call. You cannot control the value of this header.  <br>  * Zuora-Track-Id - A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you specified a tracing identifier in the request headers, Zuora returns the same tracing identifier. Otherwise, Zuora does not set this header.  <br>  |

Update a subscription

Use this call to make the following kinds of changes to a subscription:   * Add a note   * Change the renewal term or auto-renewal flag   * Change the term length or change between evergreen and termed   * Add a new product rate plan   * Remove an existing subscription rate plan   * Change the quantity or price of an existing subscription rate plan   * Change rate plans - to replace the existing rate plans in a subscription with other rate plans. Changing rate plans is currently not supported for Billing - Revenue Integration. When Billing - Revenue Integration is enabled, changing rate plans will no longer be applicable in Zuora Billing.  ### Notes * The \&quot;Update a subscription\&quot; call creates a new subscription object that has a new version number and to which the subscription changes are applied. The new subscription object has the same subscription name but a new, different, subscription ID. The &#x60;Status&#x60; field of the new subscription object will be set to &#x60;Active&#x60; unless the change applied was a cancelation or suspension in which case the status reflects that. The &#x60;Status&#x60; field of the originating subscription object changes from &#x60;Active&#x60; to &#x60;Expired&#x60;. A status of &#x60;Expired&#x60; does not imply that the subscription itself has expired or ended, merely that this subscription object is no longer the most recent. * In one request, this call can make:   * Up to 9 combined add, update, and remove changes   * No more than 1 change to terms &amp; conditions * Updates are performed in the following sequence:   1. First change the notes on the existing subscription, if requested.   2. Then change the terms and conditions, if requested.   3. Then perform the remaining amendments based upon the effective dates specified. If multiple amendments have the same contract-effective dates, then execute adds before updates, and updates before removes. * The update operation is atomic. If any of the updates fails, the entire operation is rolled back. * The response of the Update Subscription call is based on the REST API minor version you set in the request header. The response structure might be different if you use different minor version numbers.  * If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.  ### Override a Tiered Price There are two ways you override a tiered price:  * Override a specific tier number For example: &#x60;tiers[{tier:1,price:8},{tier:2,price:6}]&#x60;  * Override the entire tier structure For example:  &#x60;tiers[{tier:1,price:8,startingUnit:1,endingUnit:100,priceFormat:\&quot;FlatFee\&quot;}, {tier:2,price:6,startingUnit:101,priceFormat:\&quot;FlatFee\&quot;}]&#x60;  If you just override a specific tier, do not include the &#x60;startingUnit&#x60; field in the request.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **subscriptionKey** | **String**|  Subscription number or ID.  ID can be the latest version or any history version of ID.  * To make sure you update the last version of the subscription, use one of the following operations to retrieve the last version of ID:   * [List subscriptions by account key](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_SubscriptionsByAccount)   * [Retrieve a subscription by key](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_SubscriptionsByKey) by using the subscription number as the subscription-key * If you want to use any history version of ID, the &#x60;STABLE_ID_PUBLIC_API&#x60; permission must be enabled. Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/) to enable the permission. To retrieve a history version of ID, use the [Retrieve a subscription by key and version](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_SubscriptionsByKeyAndVersion) operation.  | |
| **puTSubscriptionType** | [**PUTSubscriptionType**](PUTSubscriptionType.md)|  | |
| **acceptEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] |
| **contentEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] |
| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraVersion** | **String**|  The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * collect * invoice * includeExistingDraftDocItems * previewType * runBilling * targetDate * taxationItems   If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you need to specify this parameter. Otherwise, an error is returned.   See [Zuora REST API Versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions) for more information.  | [optional] |

    String acceptEncoding = "acceptEncoding_example"; // Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
    String contentEncoding = "contentEncoding_example"; // Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
    String authorization = "authorization_example"; // The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
    String zuoraTrackId = "zuoraTrackId_example"; // A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
    String zuoraEntityIds = "zuoraEntityIds_example"; // An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

If you have <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Multi-Org</a> enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. 
    String chargeDetail = "chargeDetail_example"; //  The segmented rate plan charges. When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.  Possible values are:   * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.  * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).    * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.   * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified ((specific date = effectiveStartDate) OR (effectiveStartDate < specific date < effectiveEndDate)). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **subscriptionKey** | **String**| Subscription number. For example, A-S00000135.  | |
| **version** | **String**| Subscription version. For example, 1.  | |
| **acceptEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] |
| **contentEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] |
| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |
| **chargeDetail** | **String**|  The segmented rate plan charges. When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.  Possible values are:   * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.  * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate &lt;&#x3D; today’s date &lt; effectiveEndDate).    * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The &#x60;chargeSegments&#x60; field is returned in the response. The &#x60;chargeSegments&#x60; field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.   * __specific-segment&amp;as-of-date&#x3D;date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate &lt;&#x3D; specific date &lt; effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.  | [optional] |
| **excludeRatePlansWithNoCharges** | **Boolean**| If the &#x60;exclude-rate-plans-with-no-charges&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, only the active charges and rate plans will be in the response. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **getDetailedMetrics** | **Boolean**|  If the &#x60;getDetailedMetrics&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, &#x60;contractedNetMrr&#x60;, &#x60;asOfDayGrossMrr&#x60;, &#x60;asOfDayNetMrr&#x60; will be in the response. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;.  | [optional] [default to false] |
| **asOfDay** | **String**|  The date for detailed metrics. Only available when &#x60;getDetailedMetrics&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;. The date should be in the format &#x60;YYYY-MM-DD&#x60;.  The default value is the current date.   | [optional] |

Suspend a subscription

This REST API reference describes how to suspend an active subscription.   **Note**: If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, it is best practice to set the &#x60;zuora-version&#x60; parameter to &#x60;211.0&#x60; or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). Otherwise, an error occurs.

Value:  * `Today`: The subscription suspension takes effect on today's date. * `EndOfLastInvoicePeriod`: The subscription suspension takes effect at the end of the last invoice period. The suspend date defaults to a date that is one day after the last invoiced period. You can choose this option to avoid any negative invoices (credits) issued back to the customer after the subscription suspension.  * `SpecificDate`: The subscription suspension takes effect on a specific date. You must define the specific date in the `suspendSpecificDate` field. * `FixedPeriodsFromToday`: The subscription suspension takes effect after a specified period based on today's date. You must specify the `suspendPeriods` and `suspendPeriodsType` fields to define the period. 
    String subscriptionKey = "subscriptionKey_example"; // Subscription number or ID. Subscription status must be Active.

Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.  **Note:**   - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.   - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, [\\\"CreditMemo\\\", \\\"UnappliedPayment\\\"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.   - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `[\\\"CreditMemo\\\"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices. 
    Boolean applyCredit = true; // If the value is true, the credit memo or unapplied payment on the order account will be automatically applied to the invoices generated by this order. The credit memo generated by this order will not be automatically applied to any invoices.   **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide) for more information. 
    Boolean applyCreditBalance = true; // Whether to automatically apply a credit balance to an invoice.  If the value is `true`, the credit balance is applied to the invoice. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.   To view the credit balance adjustment, retrieve the details of the invoice using the Get Invoices method.  Prerequisite: `invoice` must be `true`.   **Note:**    - If you are using the field `invoiceCollect` rather than the field `invoice`, the `invoiceCollect` value must be `true`.   - This field is deprecated if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled. 
    LocalDate bookingDate = LocalDate.now(); // The booking date that you want to set for the amendment contract when you suspend the subscription. If `resume` is `true`, which means you also choose to resume the subscription at some point, then this field is also the booking date for the Resume amendment contract.  This field must be in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format. The default value of this field is the current date when you make the API call.  
    Boolean collect = false; // Collects an automatic payment for a subscription. The collection generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.  If the value is `true`, the automatic payment is collected. If the value is `false`, no action is taken.  Prerequisite: The `invoice` or `runBilling` field must be `true`.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `196.0` or later [available versions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/API-Versions/Minor-Version). 
    LocalDate contractEffectiveDate = LocalDate.now(); // The date when the customer notifies you that they want to amend their subscription. 
    String creditMemoReasonCode = "creditMemoReasonCode_example"; // A code identifying the reason for the credit memo transaction that is generated by the request. The value must be an existing reason code. If you do not pass the field or pass the field with empty value, Zuora uses the default reason code.

It represents the invoice date for invoices, credit memo date for credit memos, and debit memo date for debit memos.  - If this field is specified, the specified date is used as the billing document date.  - If this field is not specified, the date specified in the `targetDate` is used as the billing document date. 
    Boolean extendsTerm = true; // Whether to extend the subscription term by the length of time the suspension is in effect. Values: `true`, `false`. 
    Boolean invoice = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `runBilling` field. The `invoice` field is only available for backward compatibility.   Creates an invoice for a subscription. The invoice generated in this operation is only for this subscription, not for the entire customer account.   If the value is `true`, an invoice is created. If the value is `false`, no action is taken. The default value is `false`.    This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `196.0` and `207.0`. To use this field in the method, you must set the zuora-version parameter to the minor version number in the request header. 
    Boolean invoiceCollect = true; // **Note:** This field has been replaced by the `invoice` field and the `collect` field. `invoiceCollect` is available only for backward compatibility.   **Note**: This field is only available if you set the `zuora-version` request header to `186.0`, `187.0`, `188.0`, or `189.0`.

    LocalDate suspendSpecificDate = LocalDate.now(); // A specific date when the subscription suspension takes effect, in the format yyyy-mm-dd.  **Note:** This field is only applicable only when the suspendPolicy field is set to SpecificDate.  The value should not be earlier than the subscription contract effective date, later than the subscription term end date, or within a period for which the customer has been invoiced. 
    LocalDate targetDate = LocalDate.now(); // Date through which to calculate charges if an invoice or a credit memo is generated, as yyyy-mm-dd. Default is current date.   **Note:** The credit memo is only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.   This field is in Zuora REST API version control. Supported minor versions are `211.0` and later. To use this field in the method, you must set the  `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **subscriptionKey** | **String**| Subscription number or ID. Subscription status must be Active. | |
| **puTSubscriptionSuspendType** | [**PUTSubscriptionSuspendType**](PUTSubscriptionSuspendType.md)|  | |
| **acceptEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a &#x60;Content-Encoding&#x60; header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it.  | [optional] |
| **contentEncoding** | **String**| Include the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload.  | [optional] |
| **authorization** | **String**| The value is in the &#x60;Bearer {token}&#x60; format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraTrackId** | **String**| A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (&#x60;:&#x60;), semicolon (&#x60;;&#x60;), double quote (&#x60;\&quot;&#x60;), and quote (&#x60;&#39;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **zuoraEntityIds** | **String**| An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraOrgIds** | **String**| Comma separated IDs. If you have &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Central_Platform/Multi-Org\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Zuora Multi-Org&lt;/a&gt; enabled,  you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.  The IDs must be a sub-set of the user&#39;s accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails.  If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user&#39;s accessible orgs.  | [optional] |
| **zuoraVersion** | **String**| The minor version of the Zuora REST API.   You only need to set this parameter if you use the following fields: * invoice * collect * runBilling * targetDate  | [optional] |

### Return type

[**PUTSubscriptionSuspendResponseType**](PUTSubscriptionSuspendResponseType.md)

### Authorization

No authorization required

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json
 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** |  |  * Content-Encoding - This header is returned if you specify the &#x60;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#x60; request header and the response contains over 1000 bytes of data. Note that only the following MIME types support gzipped responses:   - &#x60;application/json&#x60;   - &#x60;application/xml&#x60;   - &#x60;text/html&#x60;   - &#x60;text/csv&#x60;   - &#x60;text/plain&#x60;  <br>  * RateLimit-Limit - The request limit quota for the time window closest to exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * RateLimit-Remaining - The number of requests remaining in the time window closest to quota exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * RateLimit-Reset - The number of seconds until the quota resets for the time window closest to quota exhaustion. See [rate limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits#Rate_limits) for more information.  <br>  * Zuora-Request-Id - The Zuora internal identifier of the API call. You cannot control the value of this header.  <br>  * Zuora-Track-Id - A custom identifier for tracing the API call.
