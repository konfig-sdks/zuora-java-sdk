 * API Reference
 *   # Introduction  Welcome to the REST API reference for the Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform!  To learn about the common use cases of Zuora REST APIs, check out the [REST API Tutorials](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/api-guides/overview/).  In addition to Zuora API Reference, we also provide API references for other Zuora products:    * [Revenue API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/revenue/overview/)   * [Collections API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/collections/overview/)        The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:    * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.   * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.   * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.   * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Billing Object Model.  Want to share your opinion on how our API works for you? <a href=\"https://community.zuora.com/t5/Developers/API-Feedback-Form/gpm-p/21399\" target=\"_blank\">Tell us how you feel </a>about using our API and what we can do to make it better.  Some of our older APIs are no longer recommended but still available, not affecting any existing integration. To find related API documentation, see [Older API Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/overview/).   ## Access to the API  If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the following endpoints:  | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints | |-------------------------|-------------------------| |US Cloud 1 Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com  | |US Cloud 1 API Sandbox |  https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com | |US Cloud 2 Production | https://rest.zuora.com | |US Cloud 2 API Sandbox | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com| |US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |   |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com | |US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a href=\"http://support.zuora.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> to enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611) for more information. | |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com | |EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com | |EU Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |  The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.   If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.   # Error Handling  If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1` (except [Actions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Actions) and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.  The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:  ```  {    \"success\": false,    \"processId\": \"CBCFED6580B4E076\",    \"reasons\":  [      {       \"code\": 53100320,       \"message\": \"'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN\"      }     ]  } ``` The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.  The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing, Payments, and Central Platform. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.  The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011` indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header.   When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:  <a href=\"https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg\" alt=\"Zuora Error Code Sample\"></a>   **Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field.  The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the [Error Category Codes](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Codes) section.  In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.   ## REST API Resource Codes  The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.   The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to `679999`. See <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Codes</a> in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.  ## Error Category Codes  The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field.   The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:  | Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    | |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------| | 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> for enablement. | | 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. | | 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. | | 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. | | 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. | | 23      | Missing required parameter  | The request cannot be processed because a required query parameter is missing. | Check the missing parameter name in the response message, and ensure that you include the parameter in the query. | | 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. | | 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. | | 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. | | 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> | | 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. | | 61      | Temporary error             | A temporary error occurs during request processing, for example, a database communication error. | <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs, contact <a href=\"https://support.zuora.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. </p>| | 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request limits](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/) for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> | | 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. | | 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |   # API Versions  The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.   ## Major Version   The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. In this API reference, only the **v1** major version is available. For example, `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.       Zuora also offers the [Quickstart API](https://developer.zuora.com/quickstart-api/quickstart-api-introduction/) that uses the **v2** major version. For more information about which version to use, see [Which API Should I Use](https://developer.zuora.com/api-reference-guide/).   ## Minor Version   Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it.    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error.   If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.  If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.  You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version` parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the  `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.  For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration.   ### Minor Version History  The supported minor versions are not consecutive.  You can use the following versions to override the default version (`186.0`):   - 187.0   - 188.0   - 189.0   - 196.0   - 206.0   - 207.0   - 211.0   - 214.0   - 215.0   - 216.0   - 223.0   - 224.0   - 230.0   - 239.0   - 256.0   - 257.0   - 309.0   - 314.0   - 315.0   - 329.0   - 330.0   - 336.0   - 337.0   - 338.0   - 341.0  If you set the `zuora-version` header to a version excluded from the preceding list, the corresponding API request is processed as you use the default version, `186.0`.  The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.  | Fields         | Minor Version      | REST Methods    | Description | |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------| | invoiceCollect | 189.0 and earlier  | [Create Subscription](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Subscription \"Create Subscription\");
